            <p>
                To begin with a stacked-area chart representing the 5-year rolling
                win ratio between 1995 and 2019 was produced. This visualisation
                uses data from 1990 to 2019, however the first 5 years were cut since
                they did not contain a full 5 years of data.
            </p>
            <p>
                The change of the win ratio over this period is quite interesting.
                As a whole it can be seen that, at first the win ratio underwent
                a rapid increase between 1995 and 2003 before reaching a peak.
                During the 5 years following 2003 (2003 - 2008), ther was a mild
                decline, but overall the win ratio stayed relatively constant. However,
                after 2007 there is a rapid increase in the amount of games lost, while
                the number of games drawn only sees a slight increase. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Taking a look at the visualisation for Home and Away games separately
                two different trends are seen. For home games, the win/draw/loss percentage
                is relatively constant, with some decrease in draws and losses seen
                between 2003 and 2010. The away win/draw/loss percentage is far more
                interesting. While the initial trend is similar to home games, after 
                2005 the percentage of draws steadily increases until roughly 2010, 
                when the percentage of losses begins to increase while draws decrease.
                All of this results in a massive decrease of win ratio. By the end of 2019,
                the loss percentage makes up the majority of games.
                <br/><br/>
                All of this suggests that the biggest factor behind the decrease in
                Australia's overall win percentage was overseas performance with
                home performances playing a very small role overall.
            </p>
        <h5>2.1.2 Win/Draw/Loss Percentage by Location and Country</h5>

        <h5>2.1.3 Win/Draw/Loss by Toss Result</h5>
            <p>
                One of the main aspects of the results of a test match is anecdotally
                considered to be the result of the toss (coin toss). The winner of the
                toss is given the option to either bat first or bowl first. As such,
                it is important to consider that streaks of "bac luck" where a captain
                loses many tosses in a row could result in a decrease in performance. 
            </p>
            <iframe src="./plots/toss-heatmap-against-selected-oppositions.html" 
                    scrolling="no" 
                    style="overflow:hidden;border:none;display:block;margin:auto;text-align:center;height:500px;width:1200px"></iframe>
            <p>
                This visualisation uses the toss result data to analyse home, away 
                and all toss results individually. A heatmap helps with the ability
                to spot hotspots that might not be obvious if a bar chart or scatter
                plot were used. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In this case hotspots can be seen where the toss is won and match result
                is that of a win and where the toss is lost and the match result is that
                of a loss. This is especially the case for away games against all
                oppositions. This suggests that the anecdotal evidence put forward by
                many cricket fans is indeed accurate and that winning the toss does
                have a positive influence on the likelihood of winning the game, especially
                when playing in foreign conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Perhaps, then, Australia's decrease in performance in foreign conditions can be attributed
                to an increase in the number of tosses lost. Plotting the percentage of tosses won/lost
                over time should show if there is a correlation.

                It is evident that while

        <h4>2.3 Analysing Batting</h4>
            <p>
                Another massive aspect of cricket is, surprisingly, the 
                performance of batsmen. While historically, batsmen have their
                contribution to the team measured over the course of series or
                their entire lifetime, for the purposes of this report it is
                more relavent to investigate a batsman's contribution over 
                a single year.
            </p>
            <p>There are three main aspects of a batsman's statistics:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Average - Runs per Dismissal</li>
                    <li>Strike Rate - Runs per 100 Balls Faced</li>
                    <li>Total Runs</li>
                </ol>
            <p>
                For the purposes of this analysis "Runs per Innings" was used
                over a batsman's Average as a player who is commonly "Not Out"
                at the end of the Innings could have a very high Average, while
                their actual contribution to the team's total runs is not that
                high.
                <br/><br/>
                In order to show these metrics over time the below visualisation
                was created.
            </p>
            <iframe src="./plots/runs-per-innings-all.html" 
                    scrolling="no" 
                    style="overflow:hidden;border:none;display:block;margin:auto;text-align:center;height:1200px;width:1200px"></iframe>
            <p>
                This visualisation uses the two axes to represent "Runs per Innings"
                against "Strike Rate", that is how many runs a batsman scores
                in a single inning compared to how quickly they score it. The size
                of each bubble represents the total runs scored by a particular
                batsman over a single year. The colour of the bubble represents the
                year it was scored in with a scale used to show the sequence of years.
                In addition to this, the geometric median (represented by the black crosshair) 
                was calculated for each year using the Runs per Innings and 
                Strike Rate for each player and plotted on the scatter plot for each year. 
                <br/><br/>
                As a whole, one of the most evident trends in the entire visualisation
                is the increase of strike rate over time. While purple bubbles and
                thus earlier bubbles are predominantly found on the left hand side
                of the visualisation, pink bubbles are found further to the right.
                The most recent bubbles (orange and yellow) are found scattered
                throughout suggesting more inconsistency in recent years and
                perhaps indicating that modern Australian players are far more
                inconsistent.
                <br/><br/>
                To further analyse Australia's batting, the geometric median can
                be graphed against time. This gives the following:

        <h4>2.4 Analysing Bowling</h4>
        <p>
            In order to analyse the bowling performances of the Australian team
            first, various derived columns were created. This includes columns of 
            data such as runs, wickets and balls per innings and in total over a 
            player's career for both home and away conditions. This resulted in 
            16 columns of data, which would be extremely unwieldy for a unsupervised 
            learning algorithm such as k-means or gaussian mixture. As such,
            a Principle Component Analysis was applied to reduce the number of
            columns within the data while covering close to all of the variance
            in the data. The results of the PCA can be seen below.
        </p>
        <iframe src="./plots/bowling-pca-comparisons.html" 
        scrolling="no" 
        style="overflow:hidden;border:none;display:block;margin:auto;text-align:center;height:800px;width:800px"></iframe>
        <p>
            5 components were chosen as this allows for a coverage in variance of
            around 95%. It is interesting to note that "GD McGrath" and "SK Warne" are located 
            on the extremities of most of the component against component graphs. 
            This suggests that they are outliers in terms of bowling performance, 
            however it is not yet clear (without using prior contextual knowledge) 
            if this was in a positive or negative sense. Apart from this,
            the above representation is not very useful as it doesn't
            represent any sort of tangible metrics, hence the Gaussian Mixture Models
            clustering algorithm was applied using the Scikit Learn Python module.
        </p>
        <p>
            This clustering gives 10 classes with the composition as below.
        </p>
        <iframe src="./plots/gmm-class-composition-bowlers.html" 
        scrolling="no" 
        style="overflow:hidden;border:none;display:block;margin:auto;text-align:center;height:800px;width:800px"></iframe>
        <p>
            Plotting the percentage of balls bowled by bowlers of each class over time
            results in the following.
        </p>
        <iframe src="./plots/percentage-balls-bowled-by-gmm-class.html" 
        scrolling="no" 
        style="overflow:hidden;border:none;display:block;margin:auto;text-align:center;height:800px;width:1000px"></iframe>
        <p>
            This once again suggests an interesting trend: the percentage of balls bowled 
            by Class 6 bowlers has decreased over time. There are only 3 bowlers in this
            class, specifically "GD McGrath", "SK Warne" and "NM Lyon".

            As well as this, it can also be seen that there was a dip in Class 3
            bowlers between the years of 1998 and 2008, which are surrounded by large
            peaks on either side.

            Both of these trends should be interesting to explore in more depth
            by analysing the records of specific players to see how their bowling
            or lack thereof contributed to the demise of Australian cricket.
